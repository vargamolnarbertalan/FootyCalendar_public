            <h2>Please note</h2>
            <div class="miscclass">Some wisdom for you</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Calendar API only enables selection of event color but not calendar color so you may change that manually.</li>
                <li>Events in Google Calendar added via Footy Calendar will show up in a separate calendar so you can toggle show/hide them whenever it suits you.</li>
                <li>If you have premium, each of your team will have a separate calendar in Google Calendar so you can toggle show/hide them individually.</li>
                <li>You can select a competition instead of a team if you wish so.</li>
                <li>Finding your desired team / competition can take several seconds, please be patient.</li>
                <li>Querying all of the matches usually takes more than 1 minute especially if you're syncing them with Google Calendar so please be patient.</li>
                <li>Syncing into Google Calendar does not disallow you from the .ics file download option and vice versa.</li>
                <li>A Google account can be linked to only one Footy Calendar account at a time.</li>
                <li>While above rule is met at all times, Google accounts can be relinked or you can link an other/new Google account to your Footy Calendar.</li>
                <li>Selecting preferred Google Calendar color does not affect how events will show up in a 3rd party calendar app after importing an .ics file generated by Footy Calendar.</li>
                <li>Event lenghts are estimated and are for reference only.</li>
                <li>Premium is only available through voucher codes at the moment. To apply for one send an email to footycalendarapp@gmail.com</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Footy FAQ</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="miscclass">Do I must authorize Footy Calendar for my Google account?</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Absolutely not! Feel free to use the calendar file download option only, this way you don't even have to have a Google account.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="miscclass">Why is the app asking for authorization when linking with Google Calendar?</div>
            <ul>
                <li>In order to insert/delete events in your Google Calendar you must tell Google that you allow Footy Calendar to do so and access your profile data and sensitive information such as refresh token and Google ID.</li>
                <li>For more info please follow below links to Footy Calendar's privacy policy and terms & conditions.</li>
